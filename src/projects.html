        <h5>Community Projects</h5>
          
        <h6>The Ubuntu Program</h6>
        <p>This is a project by I and Nwagba Okechuchukwu (Developer Student Club UNN Lead) as a means 
            to help bring newbie as well as intermediate developers up to speed and foster collabration 
            across communities. <br>
            The Ubuntu Program is a six (6) weeks, virtual peer learning program with the 
            focus on getting learners from Zero to a Hundred on either JavaScript or Python track.
            The pilot program started with 198 learners, 6 volunteers, 5 team members and 2 sponsors.

        </p>
          
        <h6>Ingressive Weekly</h6>
        <p>I started a newsletter for the Ingressive community in my local campus and over time it grew reaching
            audiences from other campuses and beyond. I write majorly about stuff which I think are helpful for newbies 
            and budding developers as well as include new resources every week to help them get better and become world 
            class. <br> My sources for the newsletter include social media such as twitter, blog posts, main stream newsletter
             where I curate content that I believe would not be an overkill for upcoming developers  <br>
            Currently there are about 390 - 400 subscribers to Ingressive Weekly. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h5>Volunteer Projects</h5>
        <h6>Andela Learning Community 3.0 Facilitator</h6>
        <p>I volunteered to be the Local Commmunity Ambassador for the 
            Google Africa Scholarship in partnership with Andela And Udacity, where  I served as a Facilitator
            physical meetups for ALC Nsukka where I guided learners to achieve their goals of becoming
            world class developers  and getting the  Udacity Nanodegree Scholarship. 
        </p>

        <h6>Linux Fest and Devops Days Volunteer</h6>
        <p>Scheduled to happen during 18 - 20 October 2018. I volunteered to help with
            logistics for the Conference and also help to get the design for the e-fliers for both events done. 
            I achieved this using Figma.
